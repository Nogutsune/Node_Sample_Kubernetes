# Sample_Node_App_Kubernetes
This is a simple Node App that is deployed on Kubernetes and I have used for terraform as infrastructure automation for setting master node and worker nods in EKS. 

## Directories/Files Overview ## 

- **sample_node_app** : It contains the source code (index.js & package.json) for the simple nodejs application, just prints out text on the web browser.This folder also contains Dockerfile and later I build the image and pushed to ecr repository.
